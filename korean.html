        <h1>1-<u>kimchi</u></h1>
    <p>
        Some of you may still be unfamiliar with kimchi even though it’s become highly<br>
        popular in the last 15 years here in the west. It’s basically spicy, fermented<br>
        cabbage, kind of like sauerkraut, but with Korean flavors – garlic, ginger & Korean <br>
        chilies. Kimchi is like the heart and soul of Korean cooking. And it’s tasty with so many things!<br>
        But the best thing about Kimchi? Kimchi is alive! Full of living, healthy good bacteria,<br>
        or probiotics, that boost immunity, energize the body, and aid digestion, it is believed to<br>
        fight cancer,  lower cholesterol and regulate blood sugar. Just google it and see for yourself.<br>
        Now if you are buying kimchi (which is totally fine!) just make sure it is in the refrigerated section<br>
        of the grocery store (then you know it is alive) and check for preservatives, especially nitrates- stay<br>
        away from those. 
    </p>

 <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
 <ul>
    <li>1  Napa cabbage, cut into 2-inch strips</li>
    <li>1/4-1/2 cup kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ginger, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons Korean red pepper flakes</li>
 </ul>
 <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Place cabbage in a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. Mix thoroughly<br>
        using gloves, if preferred. Place a heavy pot or pan on top with weights<br>
        and allow cabbage to sit for 1-2 hours until wilted and water has been released.
    </li>
    <li>
        Discard water after 1-2 hours. Rinse the cabbage 2-3 times in the sink until salt <br>
        is removed and allow to drain in a colander for another 15-20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Combine cabbage with remaining ingredients (through water) and mix. Using gloves,<br>
        add the Korean red pepper flakes and begin mixing and rubbing flakes into the mixture.<br>
        Add the daikon radish and green onions to mixture, stirring to combine. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Once combined, place mixture in a jar pressing down and packing tightly so that the <br>
        mixture is submerged in its own liquid. Place top on jar and allow to sit at room temperature<br>
        for 2-5 days. Place jar on a plate since the mixture may bubble over while fermenting.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each day of fermentation, remove the lid to release gases and press down on the mixture <br>
        to keep it submerged. You can taste a sample each day to decide if the level of fermentation is<br>
        to your liking.
    </li>
    <li>
        After 2-5 days of fermentation, store kimchi in refrigerator.
    </li>

    <h1>1-<u>JAJANGMYEON</u></h1>
    It is a popular noodle dish served with black bean sauce, which consists of chunjang( a salty black soybean paste), diced pork (or other kinds of meat) and vegetables. You can find it easily at a Korean Chinese restaurant.
While there are many theories about when it was first introduced to Korea, officially the first known Jajangmyeon is from a restaurant called Gonghwachun  in Chinatown of Incheon, Korea back in 1905. It was introduced by Chinese merchants but the flavor evolved to suit Korean’s taste buds over time.
It is a very common and easily accessible dish now. But when I was a child I only ate this on special occasions such as school carnival day or school entrance and graduation ceremony day. So you’ll understand how special this Jajangmyeon is to me and also to most Koreans.
