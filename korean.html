        <h1>1-<u>kimchi</u></h1>
    <p>
        Some of you may still be unfamiliar with kimchi even though it’s become highly<br>
        popular in the last 15 years here in the west. It’s basically spicy, fermented<br>
        cabbage, kind of like sauerkraut, but with Korean flavors – garlic, ginger & Korean <br>
        chilies. Kimchi is like the heart and soul of Korean cooking. And it’s tasty with so many things!<br>
        But the best thing about Kimchi? Kimchi is alive! Full of living, healthy good bacteria,<br>
        or probiotics, that boost immunity, energize the body, and aid digestion, it is believed to<br>
        fight cancer,  lower cholesterol and regulate blood sugar. Just google it and see for yourself.<br>
        Now if you are buying kimchi (which is totally fine!) just make sure it is in the refrigerated section<br>
        of the grocery store (then you know it is alive) and check for preservatives, especially nitrates- stay<br>
        away from those. 
    </p>

 <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
 <ul>
    <li>1  Napa cabbage, cut into 2-inch strips</li>
    <li>1/4-1/2 cup kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ginger, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons Korean red pepper flakes</li>
 </ul>
 <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Place cabbage in a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. Mix thoroughly<br>
        using gloves, if preferred. Place a heavy pot or pan on top with weights<br>
        and allow cabbage to sit for 1-2 hours until wilted and water has been released.
    </li>
    <li>
        Discard water after 1-2 hours. Rinse the cabbage 2-3 times in the sink until salt <br>
        is removed and allow to drain in a colander for another 15-20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Combine cabbage with remaining ingredients (through water) and mix. Using gloves,<br>
        add the Korean red pepper flakes and begin mixing and rubbing flakes into the mixture.<br>
        Add the daikon radish and green onions to mixture, stirring to combine. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Once combined, place mixture in a jar pressing down and packing tightly so that the <br>
        mixture is submerged in its own liquid. Place top on jar and allow to sit at room temperature<br>
        for 2-5 days. Place jar on a plate since the mixture may bubble over while fermenting.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each day of fermentation, remove the lid to release gases and press down on the mixture <br>
        to keep it submerged. You can taste a sample each day to decide if the level of fermentation is<br>
        to your liking.
    </li>
    <li>
        After 2-5 days of fermentation, store kimchi in refrigerator.
    </li>

        <h1>1-<u>JAJANGMYEON</u></h1>
    It is a popular noodle dish served with black bean sauce, which consists of<br>
    chunjang( a salty black soybean paste), diced pork (or other kinds of meat)<br>
    and vegetables. You can find it easily at a Korean Chinese restaurant.<br>
    While there are many theories about when it was first introduced to Korea,<br>
    officially the first known Jajangmyeon is from a restaurant called Gonghwachun<br>
    in Chinatown of Incheon, Korea back in 1905. It was introduced by Chinese merchants<br>
    but the flavor evolved to suit Korean’s taste buds over time.<br>
    It is a very common and easily accessible dish now. But when I was<br>
    a child I only ate this on special occasions such as school carnival <br>
    day or school entrance and graduation ceremony day. So you’ll understand <br>
    how special this Jajangmyeon is to me and also to most Koreans.<br>
